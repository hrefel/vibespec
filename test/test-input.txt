Build a real-time dashboard that displays sales metrics and website traffic data. The dashboard should update automatically every 5 seconds using WebSocket connections. Users should be able to add, edit, and filter the displayed data. The interface needs to be responsive and work on mobile devices. We're using React for the frontend and NestJS for the backend API. The dashboard should include charts for visualizing the data and a table for detailed information.
